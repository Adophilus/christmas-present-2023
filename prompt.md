Now here's what I actually want, I want to create a website which tells a story as the user scrolls down.

Something like this (the hash tags indicate comments):

```
# as the user scrolls down

# with a dark background
Thank you for all you've done for me

# with a lighter background
It wish the utmost joy in my heart

# with an even lighter background
That I want to wish you

# with a background suited to the christmas season 
A Merry Christmas
# (probably with a santa claus face at the bottom)

```
